Characters will grow and become stronger with experience not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No hero characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal and has a name a life. You are not the chosen one.

Human Revolution would bear replaying even without the enhancements -- its a rare title that combines superb world building and storytelling with such dedication to player choice. I lost myself in the world of Human Revolution and relished every opportunity to dive deeper into its mysteries.9/10 - PolygonWith a story that lasts hours on end additional DLC that will keep you challenged throughout (wait till you get to Missing Link) unbeatable touch-screen implementation and a majority of the same great stuff from the original release the Directors Cut of Deus Ex: Human Revolution definitely deserves a look.

The main sources of inspiration are Zelda Metroid and Portal.Supraland assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently. The story is minimal gives you an overarching goal to pursue and then sets you free. Despite child friendly visuals the game targets experienced players. Playtime: ~12-25hYou explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles. A cornerstone of Supralands design was to create abilities that are so versatile they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine your abilities the possibilities become even bigger.Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets. Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland respects your lifetime and doesnt bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles.The deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles youve never seen anywhere before encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process. And its important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome frustrating execution.The fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school fast-paced shooter games like Unreal Doom and Quake encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading.In the demo you can play the first big section of the game and decide if its for you.

All you know is that this event also spawned multiple insurmountable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy and that a strange race of aliens the Xsotan has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to surpass the torn hyperspace fabric but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them.There are also rumors about a strange new metal called Avorion which has appeared in the center of the galaxy around the same time as the Xsotan arrived. Apparently the aliens use this material to build their ships.Start out as a nobody at the edge of the galaxy and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core.

One does not get to set the rules in the world of Inner Chains. Humankind is just a small part of a hostile universe. Want to survive? Discover its secrets.      A planet in the distant future. A rock floating in space that is no longer what it had once been. Without human interference nature has been adapting to the new conditions reclaiming what was once taken away. In its pursuit of perfection it began to assimilate with the abandoned technology giving life to biomechanical beings.      Left to its own devices man-made technology has also changed as it tried to adjust to the new environment. A strong symbiosis soon developed between technology and nature. It became difficult to determine what is alive and what is mechanical in the world of Inner Chains.      After several million years of biomechanical evolution mankind once again became an important part of the ecosystem. However it hasnt regained an advanced stage of development. As a result the human race oblivious to its own history cannot fully comprehend or control the powerful technology at its disposal. The people living in the world of Inner Chains take this situation for granted and focus on using the planets resources to their advantage. There is also something that has not changed through the millennia: humans are still subject to basic social issues such as faith dominance oppression and manipulation. This led to the emergence of multiple castes and in consequence to the supremacy of one particular group. They had discovered these mechanisms first learned how to use them well that helped them rise to power. Others had to submit.  As one of the inhabitants of this world your head is filled with the teachings of the Ruling Caste. Your only goal is to get to a mythical place called the Last Hope and leave this degenerated dying planet once and for all. You embark on your journey full of fanatical zeal but soon it becomes clear that nothing is what it seems in this strange world. You have to fight for survival face hostile fauna and flora and overcome your own weaknesses. You need to stay observant to your surroundings and explore the secrets of the games world.

You play as Marines who must brave dark claustrophobic and terrifyingly intense Space Beast infested spacecraft in order to extract critical data and lucrative upgrades. Can you make it out alive?The game revolves around the concept of a procedurally generated maze-like spacecraft which is unique each time within which the Marines must search out DataCores to be downloaded. The spacecraft are infested with Beasts that are extremely lethal and the Marines must brave these dark and hostile environments in order to complete the objective of retrieving all critical data and ultimately setting the Reactor core to overload.Aside from either all purpose automatic Rifles or powerful Shotguns the Marines initially only have a rudimentary Tracker device that detects nearby motion as well as the distance to the nearest DataCore. The DataCores can however contain lucrative Upgrades that will empower the Marines with better ammunition a better motion tracker and other useful functionality that will significantly increase the chances of survival.Key to managing the unknown spaces within each spacecraft is the intelligent use of Doors sealing of sections behind the team in order to keep from being overwhelmed from several directions at once. Closing Doors controls the space but they also make it harder to flee if the need should arise.Additionally automated Sentry robots are scattered throughout the spacecraft and these can be activated in order to further aid in stemming the never ending tide of Space Beasts. Sentries offer a significant amount of additional firepower and can often be the difference between life and death when the Marines are being overwhelmed. While Sentries are programmed to avoid firing when Marines stray are in their field of fire friendly fire incidents can still happen.Once all DataCores have been retrieved the final objective is to disable all Reactor Coolants in order to destroy the spacecraft. Once this is done the Marines only have 90 seconds to find their way back to the Airlock for extraction before the Reactor overloads obliterating the spacecraft and everything aboard.Space Beast Terror Fright employs both procedural level generation as well as a procedurally arranged music scoring. Audio and visuals are all tightly synced to the action in order to deliver a super-intense combat experience that feels like an awesome action movie.Both local and networked co-op play are supported with 1-4 players via keyboard / mouse and XBox 360 game controllers. Both local and networked play allow viewing all of the action via split-screen.If you want to try out a demo of the game you can download a .zip file here: Space Beast Terror Fright Demo.

It models real world ballistics & round deflection materials penetration features a realtime day/night cycle and dynamic wind weather and environmental effects. The simulation of a combat environment is so effective the engine forms the basis for training simulators used by real armies the world over.                    Although ARMA II is set in the fictional ex-soviet state of Chernarus the gameworld is actually a 225 square kilometer chunk of the real world! ARMA IIs highly detailed landscape is a meticulous facsimile of real terrain modeled using extensive geographical data. This recreated region is brought to life with spectacular environmental effects and populated with dynamic civilian settlements and wildlife. Wild animals roam the atmospheric forests while the people of Chernarus try to live out their lives among the war-torn streets.                    The 27th U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit have been deployed to the former soviet country of Chernarus in this third installment in the series of award winning PC war simulators from Bohemia Interactive creators of Operation Flashpoint*: Cold War Crisis and ARMA: Combat Operations.

In conjunction with its story characters and setting the controls offer an empathetic look into the life of an extreme outsider trying to fit in and trying to do right by his family.  I love that. Gaming is growing up and Octodad is some of the best evidence of that.91/100 - VentureBeatOctodad: Dadliest Catch has one of the great comic premises ever attempted in video games...For much of Dadliest Catchs playtime everything works in a kind of chaotic harmony creating comedy out of every day situations that are unsurprisingly ludicrously challenging for a cephalopod in a suit.4/5 - Giant Bomb,English* Spanish - Spain Russian French German Korean Hungarian Romanian Polish Japanese Simplified Chinese Italian*languages with full audio support,http://www.octodadgame.com,Minimum:OS: Windows XP SP3Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0Ghz or equivalentMemory: 2 GB RAMGraphics: Intel Core HD Graphics 3000/4000 NVIDIA 8800 GT ATI Radeon HD 4850 or betterDirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 3 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound cardAdditional Notes: NOT SUPPORTED: ATI Radeon X1600 Intel GMA950 NVIDIA Geforce 7050,Recommended:OS: Windows 7 Windows 8Processor: Intel Core i5 2.8Ghz or equivalentMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 450 AMD Radeon HD 5670 or betterDirectX: Version 9.0Storage: 3 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card,Minimum:OS: Ubuntu 12.04 or newer other unsupported distros may workProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0Ghz or equivalentMemory: 3 GB RAMGraphics: Intel Core HD Graphics 3000/4000 NVIDIA 8800 GT ATI Radeon HD 4850 or better (Open Source Drivers NOT SUPPORTED)Storage: 3 GB available spaceSound Card: lib32-alsa-plugins or libasound2-plugins:i386 and libasound2-plugins-extra:i386 may be required.Additional Notes: NOT SUPPORTED: ATI Radeon X1600 Intel GMA950 NVIDIA Geforce 7050,Recommended:OS: Ubuntu 14.04Processor: Intel Core i5 2.8Ghz or equivalentMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 450 AMD Radeon HD 5670 or betterStorage: 3 GB available space,Minimum:OS: Mavericks 10.9 or newerProcessor: 64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0Ghz or equivalentMemory: 3 GB RAMGraphics: Intel Core HD Graphics 3000/4000 Nvidia GeForce GT 330M ATI Radeon HD 4850 or better (ATI Radeon X1600 NOT SUPPORTED)Storage: 3 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: NOT SUPPORTED: ATI Radeon X1600 Intel GMA950,Recommended:Processor: Intel Core i5 2.8Ghz or equivalentMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: GeForce GT 650M AMD Radeon HD 6750M or better,young horses,Young Horses,1966.0,False,65

Much like Earths moon Lutari has no atmosphere and its low gravity makes simple traversal relatively easy.COLONIZE GLIESE 581The primary mode of Osiris: New Dawn is now considered Colonize mode where you must explore discover and colonize every planet and moon in the solar system. Set up drone mining lines establish bases and doc at each world in your space station going planetside by using your space vehicles. Once on the surface harvest minerals gasses and plants in your bio farms all while steering clear of the countless dangers of space in this new frontier. The Explorer Update marks the beginning of this mode and will continually get more robust with further developments.HUGE PERFORMANCE AND GRAPHICS IMPROVEMENTSMassive FPS boost and complete graphics overhaul delivers a visual treat at super high frame rates even with planets full of foliage creatures and trees. This is all possible due to refined shaders materials and Unitys new Post Processing stack. Weve refined the camera systems lighting systems and terrain to achieve the highest levels of detail possible all with lightning fast speeds.UPDATED MAIN MENU AND PLAYER HUD SYSTEMSince were in the process of adding new Colonize and Mission modes the Main Menu UI has been completely reworked to allow you to view and survey the solar system as well as easily review your avatar and explore the available missions in Mission Mode. Weve also updated the in game HUD and UI to allow for backpack review while traversing and while in vehicles along with other countless improvements fixes and tweaks.CHANGES AND FEATURES ON HOLDWe listen very closely to our players and take into consideration all unique enquiries and feedback. Some features weve added during our time in Early Access did not resonate as much as others causing these certain features to be currently on hold.- SKILL TREE - Will be replaced by a new system that fits the subject matter closer.- CLASSES - May come back in Creative Mode but in order to make classes worthwhile would take the game in a very specific direction relying much more on character advancement and specialized class abilities. Were not confident that this would/has added to the game.- PUBLIC PVP SERVERS - This is tough one - but we found that trying to explore a new world while getting attacked and shot at by other explorers does not fit the spirit and subject matter of our game. We like PVP and are looking at other ways of including a PVP mode possibly in a custom server option.- MALE/FEMALE/SHAPE CUSTOMIZATIONS ON AVATARS - As much as we like these features we chose to put them on hold in order to get the space travel and new Main Menu systems in. These will likely be added back in the coming updates.- MULTIPLE AVATARS - Having a variety of avatars makes the upcoming modes a bit muddy so were exploring the idea of one astronaut avatar in the game - were hoping this adds more value to your avatar and player progression while also allowing for flexibility in your private universe by allowing you to play your avatar in any Mission or Universe. Depending on how this goes we may bring back multiple avatar banks in Creative/Custom Server mode which we would like to keep on our roadmap.ROADMAPThe following features are at the top of our development list most of which are coming along very well and just need to be added to our main development branch.Craftable Spaceships Rockets Robotics and Land Vehicles - The Laboratory will become a giant fully functional crafting center which will create a variety of parts for high tech machinery. Youll be able to fully customize different types of spacecraft land vehicles and drones all with specific abilities and properties to help you colonize the solar system.AI/Combat Improvements - Creature grappling smarter pathfinding and stealth combat have been explored and will be coming soon to make the combat in Osiris truly terrifying and visceral.Solar System Creator - Customize your very own solar system along with stars and planets to share and play with your friends! Decide what minerals flora and fauna atmosphere and creatures you choose on each planet provided it works scientifically.Other big features in development...- Digging and Bulldozing- Robust Locator/Map system- Power Distributor Gas Extractor Satellites- Deeply Integrated Repair System- VR SupportAs always were completely open to your feedback as we really want to make Osiris: New Dawn the best game it can be!

Save and invest steal and extort arrest and get arrested - in single-player and multiplayer with ranks and ladders team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates regular tournaments item drops full support of Steam Community Market - and more!HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?Gremlins Inc. is designed for up to 6 players in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit or until agreed number of rounds or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?Yes you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed) the game offers team mode (2x2 3x3 or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?Certainly! When you buy this game you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins Inc. - the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons - the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode without any connection to our server whatsoever.HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?There are different types of cards in the game (permanent regular secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are and what you currently have in your hand. Normally you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing arresting initiating player conflicts and so on). The more you play the more new strategies you will discover - especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.MAKE DECISIONS PLAN YOUR MOVESThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play the more roads to victory you discover using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after youre robbed or arrested (or both).

There are currently over 150 000 players of Gremlins Inc. on Steam from all over the world including USA Russia China Japan UK and France. Collectively players already launched several millions game sessions!FINALLY WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?You think thats just a pocket watch in your hand a watch thats a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No no and no - you couldnt be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank its own casino... and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions then its probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.More than anything in life gremlins value money political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)We felt it important to note that Gremlins Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player and everyones chances are equal.OUR DLC POLICYWe are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it you can support our efforts by your purchase. However there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player whether they have DLCs or not has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET CRAFTING AND ITEM STOREGremlins Inc. features in-game items and fully supports Steam Community Market. While playing the game certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon a new profile background a new music track or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE yours to use or trade on Steam Community Market. We the developer do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them.The game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item you can create as many such items as you wish as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want or have multiple copies of). Finally the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).ONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONSGremlins Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However this is not to say that we dont like single-player - we do and theres a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game Gremlins Inc. features both single-player and multiplayer modes and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the games server at all times - in order to support item drops Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game Gremlins vs Automatons features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERSThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game especially from China we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.,https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1579768958,This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money political power and prestige.

Save and invest steal and extort arrest and get arrested - in single-player and multiplayer with ranks and ladders team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates regular tournaments item drops full support of Steam Community Market - and more!HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?Gremlins Inc. is designed for up to 6 players in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit or until agreed number of rounds or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?Yes you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed) the game offers team mode (2x2 3x3 or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?Certainly! When you buy this game you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins Inc. - the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons - the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode without any connection to our server whatsoever.HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?There are different types of cards in the game (permanent regular secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are and what you currently have in your hand. Normally you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing arresting initiating player conflicts and so on). The more you play the more new strategies you will discover - especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.MAKE DECISIONS PLAN YOUR MOVESThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play the more roads to victory you discover using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after youre robbed or arrested (or both). With score money votes malice income and bribes the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1 000 participants.

For this reason we decided to give you the possibility to get the soundtracks on your own devices and listen to them more often than while sniping in Georgia.Listen to the short previews of some of the songs and get the whole playlists:  Composed and produced by Mikolai Stroinski (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Detached Kursk) mixed by Steve Kempster and recorded by Tony Phillips at Beautiful Noise Studios in Los Angeles each artist was invited to the studio to provide his or her own element to the overall score. Some instruments used that may be familiar to a Western audience include drum bass synthesizer guitar and vocals; but theres also the use of mandolin balalaika and bandura.Artists involved include:*Vocals - Aurelia Shrenker*Guitars Balalaika Bandura Mandolin - George Bernhardt*Synthesizers - Mikolai Stroinski*Bass - Paul Bushnell*Drum Set - Joel TaylorSome songs on the soundtrack have a noticeable Georgian touch to them and a fair amount of Sniper Ghost Warrior 3s score is inspired by various folk and pop music researched prior to the pre-production of the game score. The goal in mind for the Georgian-influenced songs are to enhance the players emotions and to emphasize the location in Georgia while also leaving the location to be painted by other elements in the game such as the graphics and dialogue.About the GameSniper Ghost Warrior 3 tells the story of brotherhood faith and betrayal in the most complete sniper experience ever.

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time resulting in realistic dynamic behavior.                                        The driving feel is authentic and visceral and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism.Environments and vehicles in BeamNG.drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design research and experience we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving.We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.Why is BeamNG.drive the game for you?As an open world vehicle simulator BeamNG.drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up upgrade it or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing such as police chases stunt challenges and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in.In some ways BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games dont let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts derby monsters or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day BeamNG.drive gives you the gameplay you want and doesnt force you to do anything that you dont think is fun or interesting.The future of the game and our physics engineAs we optimize our game and computer technology improves the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor.We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode various driving events fixing bugs and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim.Also the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real planes airframe arises naturally in BeamNG and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge.Alpha Access Features    All future updates to BeamNG.drive included for free (alpha beta) also including the final game    Soft-body physics sandbox    19 detailed customizable destructible vehicles with more to come    10 terrains to explore and drive across with more to come    Frequent updates adding terrains vehicles features gameplay and bug fixes    Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles and script gameplay    Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling image editing and text editing software    Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run.Alpha TestersUsers that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key.Our goalsOur main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this we are designing the engine and corresponding assets so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system.Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL.Our missionTo have realistic accurate destructible and malleable physics everywhere.

Wisely place and connect factories houses and warehouses and make the most efficient connections.Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life such as playgrounds cinema s taverns and shops.Send your citizens to the mine to get coal iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods.Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings.Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles as well as realistic landscapes of the 60s to the 90s.Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live.Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play -one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources.Increasing difficulty.As prices change the demands of the citizens also change and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work.RESOURCES & INDUSTRYThere are right now over 30 commodities you can mine transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them.Every commodity has a specific requirementso if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks while resources like wood steel or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes food etc. can be stored in warehouses.WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDSEvery worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat clothes alcohol or electronics. Also to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time - cinema playgrounds taverns etc.Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher or researcher or work in factories with special requirements.TRANSPORTATIONYou have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But dont forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time.ECONOMY SIMULATION The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron coal and work and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction.You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper.As time increases so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as for example less human work is needed with advanced technologies) so later with more complexity it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.,https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/784150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1581787138,Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic is the ultimate real-time soviet-themed city builder tycoon game.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive dominate... and escape!Dinosaurs Creatures & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed you can issue commands to your tames which it may follow depending on how well youve tamed and trained it. Tames which can continue to level-up and consume food can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains lift allies over enemy walls race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply raise babies!You must eat and drink to survive with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts including ramps beams pillars windows doors gates remote gates trapdoors water pipes faucets generators wires and all manner of electrical devices and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs textual billboards and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you plant them in plots that you lay down water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories which can then be composted and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations you can capture the attention of the one of the ARKs god-like mythical creatures who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.Create a Tribe and add your friends to it and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources including the tallest mountains darkest caves and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions Level-Up your tames and learn new Engrams to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair eye and skin tones along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK youll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past in the form of collectible detailed 3D Explorer Notes. By uncovering all of these you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK and discover its purpose!Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired and when you leave the game your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen so to achieve security you must build-up team-up or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent and you can even knock out capture and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes such as extracting their blood to for transfusions harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment composed of many natural and unnatural structures above-ground below-ground and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets youll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration write custom points of interest onto it and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.On the 100+ player servers your character everything you built and your tames stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARKs by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs each slightly different than the previous to leave your mark on and conquer one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore you can now design or randomize your own unique Procedurally Generated ARKs for infinite replayability and endless surprises.You can play single-player local games and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example.
